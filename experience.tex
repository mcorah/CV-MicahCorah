    \begin{cvitems} % Description(s) bullet points
    \item Advisor: \emph{Prof. Nathan Michael}
    \item Developed algorithms and analysis techniques for multi-robot sensing,
      coverage, exploration, and target tracking based on submodular
      maximization, higher-order monotonicity conditions, and spatial locality
    \item Design and analysis of a planner for exploration at high speed (2.25
      m/s) with an aerial robot in collaboration with Kshitij Goel and Curtis
      Boirum.
      This system was tested in simulation and on a hexrotor robot, outdoors, on
      the CMU campus
    \item Developed a system for multi-robot exploration combining Cauchy-Schwarz
      mutual information for ranging sensors, Monte-Carlo tree search for path
      planning, and multi-robot planning via submodular maximization
    \item Implemented core components of a system providing control and autonomy
      for aerial robots.
      Contributions include trajectory representation and management and a
      modular finite state machine
