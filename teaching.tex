    \begin{cvitems}
      \item Core course in the \href{https://mrsd.ri.cmu.edu/}{Masters in
        Robotics Systems Development} (MRSD) program
      \item Gave two lectures of the \emph{Aerial Mobility} component:
        \emph{Model Predictive and Adaptive Control}
        and
        \emph{Trajectory Generation and Tracking}
      \item Revised and expanded material for each lecture.
        Improved emphasis on concrete applications and introduced discussion of
        autonomy system design and safe navigation with respect to flatness-basd
        trajectory generation
